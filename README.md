# Chair-Simulator
A program to determine your best use of existing stock towards finished product

This program reads a bill of materials & stock overview that is stored in a .txt file to determine which quantity of good, in this case chairs, you can produce.
The .txt file is structured to show production group (i.e. part of the chair), configuration of the production group, needed parts per chair, and stock level.
Each entry is stored in a new line and the values use spaces as delimiters.

In the next steps, this program should also calculate the monetary stock impact, allow for user input on whether to focus on highest quantity or highest value, as well as make suggestions on what to buy to produce more.
